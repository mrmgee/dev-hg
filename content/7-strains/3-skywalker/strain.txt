St0r-Indica Skywalker desctiption text here
A dank and potent strain, Skywalker OG offers a super relaxed high with a nice blend of hybrid effects. An indica-dominant beauty that weighs in at 85/15, it’s the lovechild of Skywalker and OG Kush. Like its namesake, it will bring strong kush attributes and leave you feeling like you’re in the clouds for hours.
